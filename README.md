2. Create a model to predict if a certain employee will leave or stay.

# Analysis
Checked on how overall employee satisfaction, tenure, and evaluation were the three main influences determining staff departures.

1. Employees with lower to medium-range salaries are more likely to resign. Conversely, staff employees with higher salaries are less-likely to quit.
2. Employee turnover is higher in Sales, Support and the Technical areas. Conversely, the least employee turnover is in Management.
