# People Analytics, Human Resources Turnover

## Goal(s)
1. Understand what are the factors contribute to employee turnover. 
2. Create a model to predict if a certain employee will leave or stay.

# Analysis
Checked on how overall employee satisfaction, tenure, and evaluation were the three main influences determining staff departures.

Conclusions:

Employee Satisfaction, Years At Company, Evaluation are the biggest factors regarding staff turnover.

1. Low to medium salaried employees had higher attrition rates. Conversely, higher-salaried employees has lower attrition rates. 
2. Highest employee turnover (ranked order) Sales, Technical, Support. Conversely, Management lowest employee turnover.
3. High employee turnover 2, 6, 7 projects; most employees with 3, 4, 5 projects remained; all employees with 7 projects left the company.
4. Low to high performance employees tended to leave the most; employee evaluations between 0.6-0.8 tended to remain at the company. 
5. Employees with less hours of work (150 hours or less) or (250 hours or more) had higher attrition rates.
6. Low satisfaction level employees (0.2 or less) or (0.3~0.5) and high satisfaction level employees (0.7 or more) all left the company at higher rates. 
7. More than 1/2 of employees with 4 and 5 years tenure left the company.
8. An average evaluation of roughly 70% meant an employee was likely to stay (even with difference project counts); the data skews towards a high turnover rate after 3 projects or two projects and a lower employee evaluation; employees with more than 3 projects and higher employee evaluations also had higher attrition rates. 
9. Using a Random Forest was the most accurate for data modeling purposes.

Suggestions: 

Use the Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model as part of conducting a Root-cause Analysis 

1. Reaction - Conduct a company-wide survey of all employees
2. Learning - Based on the survey's results implement on-the-job training aimed at reducing attrition rates
3. Behavior - Monitor if desired improvements are being incorporated or if there is still cultural resistance
4. Results - Reduced employee turnover; increased employee evaluation scores 

The above should center on, what are the knowledge, motivation, and organizational solutions to these barriers?

Areas to address include: 

1. Overall attrition-rates
2. Sales, Technical and Support turnover rates, i.e., KPI's; Salary; Management; Career Mobility; finding the possible causes / solutions?
3. Project-related turnover rates; lack of support; level of difficulties; timelines; again, finding the possible causes / solutions?
4. Employee satisfaction; what (if anything) is being done about this? Re-assess management (including Human Resources' policies to find the possible areas where this can be addressed and improved).
5. Employee retention, i.e., in the 4 to 5 year-segment means knowledge, motivation, and organizational is being lost (aside from the people who left with such).
6. Examining why project count; employee evaluation and attrition are correlated and determining causation.
